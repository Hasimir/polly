# iframe authentication example

The purpose of this prototype is to display how one could use an ordinary HTTP call to authenticate to the Polly server, and have the socket.io socket inform the end-user of its success without leaving the application page.

Run `server.py` and connect to `localhost:8888` to try it out.
